<div class="offset-top-30 offset-md-top-50">
<p>ElasTest is a platform aimed to ease end to end (e2e) testing of distributed systems. One of the key features of the platform is the ability to show and analyze logs and metrics of all elements involved in an end to end test.</p><p>For example, suppose a typical three tier web application with a database. A basic e2e test has the following components: the test itself, web browser, web application and database. All those elements can generate logs and metrics of several types (CPU, memory, network packetsâ€¦). When a test is executed using ElasTest, the tester can see all that monitoring information in the same graphical user interface and with advanced analysis features.

<blockquote>WARNING: ElasTest is currently in active development. This means that new features are constantly being added and unexpected bugs may appear.</blockquote>
