<h2 id="content" class="h1">What is ElasTest?</h2>
<div class="offset-top-30 offset-md-top-30">
<p>ElasTest is a platform aimed to ease end to end testing of distributed systems. The two key features of the platform are: 1) Provide an easy deployment process and easy access to the necessary services usually involved in an end to end test and 2) Provide easy-to-use tools to show and analyze logs and metrics of all elements involved in an end to end test.</p><p>For example, suppose a typical three tier web application with a database. A basic e2e test has the following components: the test itself, web browser, web application and database. All those elements have to be properly deployed, linked and executed, and all of them can generate logs and metrics of several types (CPU, memory, network packetsâ€¦). A test being executed in ElasTest can make direct use of multiple integrated services (such as Web Browsers), and the tester can see all that monitoring information in the same graphical user interface and with advanced analysis features.

<h3 class="holder-subtitle link-top" id="elastest-core-concepts">ElasTest core concepts</h3>

<p>
ElasTest is built around 3 main elements:

<div style="margin-top: 30px">
    <h4 id="sut" class="link-top">Software under Test (SuT)</h4>
    The tested software itself. ElasTest supports two deployment modes of SuT:
    <ul>
        <li><i>SuT deployed by ElasTest</i>: your software is packaged as Docker container/s. It can be a single Docker image or a docker-compose.</li>
        <li><i>SuT outside ElasTest</i>: your software is already deployed somewhere.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 30px">
    <h4 id="tjob" class="link-top">Test Job (TJob)</h4>
    Test to be executed against your SuT. In a TJob several things have to be specified:
    <ul>
        <li><i>Environment to execute the tests</i>: This is defined with a docker image that contains all tools used by the tests.</li>
        <li><i>How to retrieve and execute the tests</i>: Specified as a set of commands written in bash that will be executed inside the docker container defined as environment.</li>
        <li><i>The SuT against which the tests are executed</i>: That is, the SuT description. If the SuT is deployed by ElasTest, it only needs the Docker image or docker-compose. If the Sut is outside ElasTest, it is necessary to specify how to reach it (usually with its IP).</li></br>
    </ul>
    A TJob can be executed several times. That can be useful, for example, because SuT has changes and we want to verify that old features are still working. Or if we add more tests to the same TJob test repo, we can execute them against the SuT.
</div>

<div style="margin-top: 30px">
   <h4 id="tss" class="link-top">Services</h4>
   Services offered by ElasTest to ease the execution and analysis of TJobs. At the moment, ElasTest only provides <strong>Web Browser Service</strong> and <strong>Log Analyzer Service</strong>, but in the near future ElasTest will offer other services as <strong>mobile devices emulators</strong>, <strong>IoT devices</strong>, <strong>security services</strong> and <strong>Big Data services</strong>.
</div>

<!--<blockquote>
These three elements are the core concepts of ElasTest platform and they are also the <strong>components targeted</strong> by ElasTest platform.
<br>
In other words: <strong>SuT's, TJob's and TSS's are the modules that ElasTest can monitor and analyse for you</strong>. You can gather information and check logs and metrics for any SuT, TJob or TSS. To learn more check <a href="/docs/monitoring">Monitoring</a> section.

<h3 id="modes" class="holder-subtitle link-top">ElasTest modes</h3>

ElasTest has different execution modes:

##### Over Docker

-   **Mini** (mini): This mode is intended for testing on a **`laptop`** or **`small server`**.
-   **Single-Node** (singlenode): This mode is intended for testing on **`servers`** with with better technical characteristics. The main differences with **`mini`** are:
    -   Logs and metrics are stored in ElasticSearch and processed with Logstash, while in mini they are saved in MySQL.
    -   Modular architecture based on containers (ESM)
    -   The ElasTest Platform Monitoring service is available

##### Over Kubernetes

-   **EK** (ElasTest over Kubernetes): For **`elastic`** environments. Similar to ElasTest mini (Docker)
-   **HEK** (Highly Scalable ElasTest Kubernetes soon): ElasTest with high availability over Kubernetes. Similar to ElasTest single-node (Docker)

In the ([Try ElasTest](/try-elastest/)) section you can find out more about how to start a specific mode and what its technical features are.
