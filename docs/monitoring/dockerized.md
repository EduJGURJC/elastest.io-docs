When launching tests against Dockerized SuTs, ElasTest manages the SuT lifecycle itself and can use Docker features of [logs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/) and [metrics](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stats/) to automatically get monitoring information from it. This is the quickest and easiest way of monitoring with ElasTest.
