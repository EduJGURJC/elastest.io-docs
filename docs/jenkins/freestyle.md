As mentioned above, the ElasTest plugin can also be used from a freestyle project, although at the moment it only offers some basic functionalities:

-   Send the logs generated during the build of a Job to ElasTest
-   Request an EUS TSS (a support services that provides browsers on demand), which can be used during the build.
-   Send the test results report generated by the build to ElasTest

To configure a Freestyle Job with ElasTest integrated, you will must select the _Integrate Jenkins with ElasTest_ field. In this case, the _EUS_ field is not required that is why this example do not need a web browser.

To complete this freestyle job, you must download the project inside of this [repository](https://github.com/elastest/demo-projects) and introduce **`cd ./unit/junit5-unit-test;mvn test`** in the **Build command**.

After we run the Freestyle Job, we can check the results in both platforms, **Jenkins** and **ElasTest**.
